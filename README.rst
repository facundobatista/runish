What is runish?
===============

A Unicode name finder and characters explainer.

Simple to use::

    $ runish umbrella
    ‚òÇ  UMBRELLA
    ‚òî UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS
    ‚õ±  UMBRELLA ON GROUND
    üåÇ CLOSED UMBRELLA
    üèñ BEACH WITH UMBRELLA

    $ runish ‚òÇ
    UMBRELLA

In that simple use case it tries to guess what are you asking for (one letter -> explain; more -> find). 

You can also be explicit passing ``-e/--explain`` or ``-f/--find`` to select the behaviour mode::

    $ runish -e b≈ìuf
    b  LATIN SMALL LETTER B
    ≈ì  LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
    u  LATIN SMALL LETTER U
    f  LATIN SMALL LETTER F
